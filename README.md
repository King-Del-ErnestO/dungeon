# Dungeon
**Simple game made using if-elif-else statements. Project for beginners**

## Requirements
Python 3

## How to Play
This  is an interactive game. You will have to enter choices to navigate the game.

1. Enter your details.
2. You will be prompted to respond to certain tasks (as questions), response choices will be provided. Eg *Would you like to turn left or right (Enter 'left' or 'right')*
3. A right choice will take you closer to winning and a wrong choice will take you closer to loosing.
4. The objective of the game is to win by responding correctly to all the tasks.


##Project Structure

Here I used Object oriented approach. Its just a fancy way to represent the code which improves code readability and let devs work more on different modules independently.
1. Info.py - will help you to get players info.
2. Game.py - will describe the rules of the game.
3. dungeon.py - Is main file which drives the whole process.

Now whole process is well organized to develope further features. ;)

Enjoy!
